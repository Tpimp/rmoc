# rmoc
Qt5 MOC tool enhanced for built-in remote objects


Version 5.12 from Git Feb 15th 2019


How To Build?

Edit your qoobjectdef.h file (make a copy of the original if you are worried), described here [RemoteInvokeMetaMethod](https://github.com/ProtozeFOSS/qremoteobject/wiki/Missing-reference-to-RemoteInvokeMetaMethod) - Very easy edit

With a valid Qt5 (check your version) install:
> qmake

> make -j <cpus>
